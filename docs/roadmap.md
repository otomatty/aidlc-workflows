# AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 - Roadmap

Status as of 2026-09-03.

- The current v2 version is **2.7.0** (`origin/main` tip `96b11d39`).
  Version numbers describe the committed framework tree, not GitHub Releases.
- AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 is **GA** on the default `main` branch. Use `main` for
  new installations and upgrades. The earlier implementation is maintained
  separately on `v1`.
- Release publication is not yet aligned with `main`: GitHub still marks
  `v1.0.1` as Latest, tracked by #635. The native distribution implementation
  for #722 remains under review in #756; no public v2 native release exists yet.
- PR validation now includes the deterministic integration and end-to-end tiers
  in addition to smoke, unit, packaging, typecheck and lint (#791).

The version numbers below describe where work landed on `main`. Future
themes and open pull requests are directional, not committed release promises.

## North star reference

The seven functional goals of the AI-DLC Workflows 2.0 North Star, verbatim in intent:

1. **Mimic what we practice in the real world** - a stage executed by a
   configurable ensemble (Owner, Collaborator, Verifier) with consistent
   semantics across harnesses.
2. **Customization of behaviour** - encode new behaviours, policies, or
   constraints in no more than two targeted changes, reusable across harnesses
   without tool-specific rewrites.
3. **Adaptiveness of workflows** - scale in (report triage to compact Fix, Test,
   PR) and scale out (decide next stages at boundaries); composition not
   hard-wired.
4. **Verifier as a true adversary** - adversarial quality gate; may use a
   different LLM than the producer; validates against machine-checkable
   evidence; budgeted self-heal loop escalating to HITL.
5. **Support for cyclic, directional flows** - forward progression plus
   governed, directional feedback loops.
6. **Preserve artefact traceability** - downstream stages enrich upstream
   artefacts rather than spawning disconnected ones.
7. **Organizational, not project-local, artefact repository** - shared org
   knowledge layer across projects, intents, and repos; six named scenarios.

## Strategic delivery pillars

Two strategic pillars shape how the North Star reaches users and evolves:

- **Productization and distribution (#722)** - make AI-DLC straightforward to
  install, configure, upgrade, release and roll back across supported harnesses.
- **Plugin ecosystem and marketplace (#723)** - make trusted extensions
  discoverable, installable and reusable, with a clear path from external plugin
  to first-party capability.

## Directional themes

These themes are supported by open RFCs, issues or implementation pull requests,
but do not yet have committed release versions.

### Traceability and progressive enrichment

- Per-stage upstream traceability enforcement shipped in
  [#401](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/401). Source-bound review
  evidence shipped in
  [#646](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/646), stale stage-result
  propagation shipped in
  [#716](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/716), and per-Unit
  attribution shipped in
  [#813](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/813).
- Cross-unit discovery propagation remains open
  ([#299](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/299)/[#300](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/300)).
- Preserve progressive enrichment as the North Star destination: downstream
  stages enrich upstream artefacts in place, with ADRs as a core design artefact.
- Commit-level provenance remains an open design question; the current audit
  chain does not provide a durable reverse lookup from an arbitrary source commit
  to its intent and workflow.

### Governed feedback loops

- [#616](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/616) shipped one
  bounded Build & Test to Code Generation return path for
  [#611](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/611). It is an
  incremental loop, not a general cyclic graph engine.
- General cross-stage backward edges still need engine-level governance, stale
  artefact handling and explicit human authorization.

### Plugins and marketplace

- The plugin mechanism, content projection, selection and plugin-contributed
  scopes are shipped; the plugin test kit and authoring tiers shipped in
  [#792](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/792).
- Plugin-extensible doctor checks shipped in
  [#797](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/797). The offline plugin
  CREATE, VALIDATE, BUILD, and TEST authoring tiers ship as
  the standalone `aidlc-plugin-create.ts`, `aidlc-plugin-validate.ts`,
  `aidlc-plugin-build.ts`, and `aidlc-plugin-test.ts` tools. The top-level
  `plugin validate` and `plugin build` routes also ship. Top-level
  `plugin create` and `plugin test` routes remain proposed in
  [#723](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/723).
  Remote discovery, trust, a first-party marketplace and a graduation path are
  also proposed in #723.
  Product discovery
  ([#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652),
  [#782](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/782)) and design
  ([#527](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/527)) are candidates
  for first-party plugins.
- `aidlc-plugin-test.ts` exercises composition against a disposable copy of an
  install for external plugin authors.

### Knowledge and documents

- [#731](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/731) shipped
  DocumentKB's first indexing and citation slice. Summaries and tags shipped in
  [#894](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/894), completing that
  metadata slice of the tracked
  [#714](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/714) RFC.
- [#694](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/694) tracks
  intent-aware discovery and auditable supplemental-knowledge delivery across
  stage topologies.

### Product discovery

- Core Ideation delivery remains under review in
  [#526](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/526), with an
  external-handover contract in
  [#586](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/586) and a
  plugin-shaped alternative in
  [#652](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/652).
- The delivery surface, core versus first-party plugin, is not yet settled.

### Installation, upgrades and releases

- The GA implementation and its active development line now live on `main`.
  The earlier implementation remains on `v1`.
- [#722](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/722) covers binary
  packaging, installers, release automation, rollback and post-install setup;
  its milestones 1-3 implementation is under review in
  [#756](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/756). The earlier Bun
  dependency tracker [#399](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/399)
  is closed as superseded by #722.
- [#636](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/636) tracks a
  first-class upgrade contract. The earlier implementation PR
  [#535](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/535) closed without
  merging.
- [#635](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/635) tracks the
  mismatch between the v2 GA `main` branch and GitHub's Latest release still
  pointing at `v1.0.1`.

### Harness expansion and parity

- GitHub Copilot support shipped in
  [#657](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/657), and its RFC
  [#472](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/472) is closed.
- Cursor support shipped in
  [#661](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/661). A unified Kiro
  distribution is under review in
  [#775](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/775). Native Kiro IDE
  surfaces shipped in
  [#824](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/824), closing
  [#555](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/555), and hook matcher
  hardening shipped in
  [#788](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/788).
- Antigravity setup is proposed in
  [#690](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/690).

### Evaluation and operations

- [#684](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/684) proposes
  repeatable benchmarks for measuring AI-DLC outcomes. Evaluator work is active
  in [#753](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/pull/753); the earlier
  harness-evaluation tracker
  [#223](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/223) closed as not
  planned for v1.
- Operations-phase steering remains a requested direction
  ([#221](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/221),
  [#473](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/issues/473)), not an active
  `main` implementation stream.

## Known gaps

- Stage-specific rules (`aidlc-stage-<slug>.md`) are reserved but unbuilt.
- Plugin `when:` evaluation, remote discovery and marketplace trust remain open.
- Write-fired sensors remain advisory; gate-bound sensors support blocking
  severity and human-backed override.
- General cross-stage cycles and progressive in-place artefact enrichment remain
  North Star gaps.
- The unified Kiro distribution remains under review in #775.
- Older community PR #526 remains open and needs rebasing or disposition. PRs
  #432, #535, #552, #653 and #712 closed without merging.
